aprimon.intro.title= What are Aprimons?
aprimon.intro.description=Aprimon are Pokemon who have been caught in a special, hard to obtain pokeball. When a shiny is caught in one of these, it significantly increases the value of the Pokemon in trades because you essentially have a rare mon inside of a rare ball.
aprimon.apriballs.title=What are Apriballs?
aprimon.apriballs.description=Apriballs are hard to find, \
  rare balls within the Pokemon series. They are generally made from Apricorns \
  in the game, thus the name. However, a few other rare balls get lumped in with them too. \
  Each Apriball has its own special attribute but these were normally used in the older games \
  where they were more numerous. Now Apriballs are mostly used for aesthetic. Here’s \
  a comprehensive list of Apriballs for your reference.
aprimon.importance.title=Why Is This Important?
aprimon.importance.description=Aprimon are considered “high value trades” even when they are not shiny because \
  of the rare balls they are in. Most non shiny Aprimon are used to breed higher value, shiny Pokemon because parents\
  \ have a 50% chance of passing down their pokeball when bred with a Pokemon in the same egg type and 100% when bred \
  with a ditto. Getting an Aprimon for breeding is a lot easier than taking the risk of trying to catch your preferred \
  Pokemon in a ball. This is a big deal for Masuda Method users who often use foreign dittos because this will guarantee\
  \ a 100% chance of passing it down to their potentially shiny offspring.
